### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was my second one in frontednmentor.io,
Which gave me more expierence in CSS and flexbox, I came to this project with better knowledge and more confidence.
In addition, This project was built using JavaScript, which I enjoyed coding in.
I've learned a new way to implement vanilla JS in HTML & CSS



### Continued development

I want to continue to code in JavaScript in the future, also, I want to learn to use CSS Grid better. 
I feel like I'm comfortable with Flexbox and would like to expand my knowledge with Grid.
